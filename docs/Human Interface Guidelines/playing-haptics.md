# Playing haptics

Playing haptics can engage people’s sense of touch and bring their familiarity with the physical world into your app or game.

![A sketch of a horizontal line of three slightly overlapping circles, suggesting vibration. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted orange to subtly reflect the orange in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/367115f42d7b6235a3087fd140366955/patterns-playing-haptics-intro%402x.png)

Depending on the platform and the device people are using, the system can play haptics in addition to visual and auditory feedback. For example, components like switches, sliders, and pickers automatically play haptic feedback on supported iPhone models; on Apple Watch, the Taptic Engine generates haptics for a number of built-in feedback patterns, which watchOS combines with an audible tone. On a Mac that’s equipped with a Force Touch trackpad, an app can play haptics while people drag content or when they force click to change the speed of media controls.

In addition to built-in haptic capabilities, some external input devices can also play haptics. For example:

- In an iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, or visionOS app or game, [game controllers](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/game-controls) can provide haptic feedback (for developer guidance, see [Playing Haptics on Game Controllers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreHaptics/playing-haptics-on-game-controllers)).

- [Apple Pencil Pro](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/apple-pencil-and-scribble) and some trackpads can provide haptic feedback when connected to certain iPad models. (For details on Apple Pencil features and compatibility, see [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/).)


## [Best practices](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics\#Best-practices)

**Use system-provided haptic patterns according to their documented meanings.** People recognize standard haptics because the system plays them consistently on interactions with standard controls. If the documented use case for a pattern doesn’t make sense in your app or game, avoid using the pattern to mean something else. Instead, use a generic pattern or create your own, where supported. For guidance, see [Custom haptics](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics#Custom-haptics).

**Use haptics consistently throughout your app or game.** It’s important to build a clear, causal relationship between each haptic and the action that causes it so people learn to associate certain haptic patterns with certain experiences. If a haptic doesn’t reinforce a cause-and-effect relationship, it can be confusing and seem gratuitous. For example, if your game plays a specific haptic pattern when a character fails to finish a mission, people associate that pattern with a negative outcome. If you use the same haptic pattern for a positive outcome like a level completion, people will be confused.

**Prefer using haptics to complement other feedback in your app or game.** When visual, auditory, and tactile feedback are in harmony — as they generally are in the physical world — the user experience is more coherent and can seem more natural. For example, you generally want to match the intensity and sharpness of a haptic with the intensity and sharpness of the animation it accompanies. You can also synchronize sound with haptics; for developer guidance, see [Delivering Rich App Experiences with Haptics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreHaptics/delivering-rich-app-experiences-with-haptics).

**Avoid overusing haptics.** Sometimes a haptic can feel just right when it happens occasionally, but become tiresome when it plays frequently. Doing user testing can help you discover a balance that most people appreciate. Often, the best haptic experience is one that people may not be conscious of, but miss when it’s turned off.

**In most apps, prefer playing short haptics that complement discrete events.** Although long-running haptics that accompany a gameplay flow can enhance the experience, long-running haptics in an app can dilute the meaning of the feedback and distract people from their task. On Apple Pencil Pro, for example, continuous or long-lasting haptics don’t tend to clarify the writing or drawing experience and can even make holding the pencil less pleasant.

**Make haptics optional.** Let people turn off or mute haptics, and make sure people can still enjoy your app or game without them.

**Be aware that playing haptics might impact other user experiences.** By design, haptics produce enough physical force for people to feel the vibration. Ensure that haptic vibrations don’t disrupt experiences involving device features like the camera, gyroscope, or microphone.

## [Custom haptics](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics\#Custom-haptics)

Games often use custom haptics to enhance gameplay. Although it’s less common, nongame apps might also use custom haptics to provide a richer, more delightful experience.

You can design custom haptic patterns that vary dynamically, based on user input or context. For example, the impact players feel when a game character jumps from a tree can be stronger than when the character jumps in place, and substantial experiences — like a collision or a hit — can feel very different from subtle experiences like the approach of footsteps or a looming danger.

There are two basic building blocks you can use to generate custom haptic patterns.

- _Transient_ events are brief and compact, often feeling like taps or impulses. The experience of tapping the Flashlight button on the Home Screen is an example of a transient event.

- _Continuous_ events feel like sustained vibrations, such as the experience of the lasers effect in a message.


Regardless of the type of haptic event you use to generate a custom haptic, you can also control its _sharpness_ and _intensity_. You can think of sharpness as a way to abstract a haptic experience into the waveform that produces the corresponding physical sensations. Specifying sharpness lets you relay to the system your intent for the experience. For example, you might use sharpness values to convey an experience that’s soft, rounded, or organic, or one that’s crisp, precise, or mechanical. As the term implies, intensity means the strength of the haptic.

By combining transient and continuous events, varying sharpness and intensity, and including optional audio content, you can create a wide range of different haptic experiences. For developer guidance, see [Core Haptics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreHaptics).

## [Platform considerations](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics\#Platform-considerations)

### [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics\#iOS)

On supported iPhone models, you can add haptics to your experience in the following ways:

- Use standard UI components — like [toggles](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toggles), [sliders](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sliders), and [pickers](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/pickers) — that play Apple-designed system haptics by default.

- When it makes sense, use a feedback generator to play one of several predefined haptic patterns in the categories of [notification](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics#Notification), [impact](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics#Impact), and [selection](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics#Selection) (for developer guidance, see [`UIFeedbackGenerator`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIFeedbackGenerator)).


#### [Notification](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics\#Notification)

Notification haptics provide feedback about the outcome of a task or action, such as depositing a check or unlocking a vehicle.

**Selection.** Indicates that a UI element’s values are changing.

### [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics\#macOS)

When a Magic Trackpad is available, your app can provide one of the three following haptic patterns in response to a drag operation or force click.

| Haptic feedback pattern | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Alignment | Indicates the alignment of a dragged item. For example, this pattern could be used in a drawing app when the people drag a shape into alignment with another shape. Other scenarios where this type of feedback could be used might include scaling an object to fit within specific dimensions, positioning an object at a preferred location, or reaching the beginning/end or minimum/maximum of something like a scrubber in a video app. |
| Level change | Indicates movement between discrete levels of pressure. For example, as people press a fast-forward button on a video player, playback could increase or decrease and haptic feedback could be provided as different levels of pressure are reached. |
| Generic | Intended for providing general feedback when the other patterns don’t apply. |

For developer guidance, see [`NSHapticFeedbackPerformer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSHapticFeedbackPerformer).

### [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-haptics\#watchOS)

Apple Watch Series 4 and later provides haptic feedback for the Digital Crown, which gives people a more tactile experience as they scroll through content. By default, the system provides linear haptic detents that people can feel as they rotate the Digital Crown. Some system controls, like table views, provide detents as new items scroll onto the screen. For developer guidance, see [`WKHapticType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WatchKit/WKHapticType).

watchOS defines the following set of haptics, each of which conveys a specific meaning to people.
